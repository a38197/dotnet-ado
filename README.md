School project to explore ADO and EntityFramework

In this project we have a single presentation layer that consumes data from a certain source. 
That source can an ADO connected environment or and EntityFramework environment.

The data definitions contain enough metadata to the presentation layer be dynamic acording to the table structure (I
am lazy when it comes to GUI :) )
